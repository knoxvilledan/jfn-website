I am semi new to coding. I need to improve my life.I'm sure that this is probably inappropriate spot to make such a personal declaration. That's where I'm at. I'm sick and tired of being sick and dang tired
So now I'm going to Do. I'm just gonna do things. I'm gonna build something. Then I'm gonna keep building things again and again, until I get it.

Reset / Restart. I'm wrapping up day 46. 46 more to go. I'm sure it's gonna start to show to. I project about 14 on this plan and good stuff is coming.
This has been 46 days of mostly just figuring out the mapbook, and where the heck I was at. "GPS" wasn't working for me. Had to dig deep to understand to the level that I can truly focus in on learning.

And really the last 26 days has been the most growth in understanding. I'm looking forward to the weigh-in on 12-15-23
