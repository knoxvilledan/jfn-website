I am semi new to coding. I need to improve my life.I'm sure that this is probably inappropriate spot to make such a personal declaration. That's where I'm at. I'm sick and tired of being sick and dang tired
So now I'm going to Do. I'm just gonna do things. I'm gonna build something. Then I'm gonna keep building things again and again, until I get it.
